description: Exchange your Bitcoin or Ethereum for Solana
---

# Exchange ETH/BTC

Begin by signing up with an [exchange](exchanges.md).

Send Bitcoin or Ethereum to your exchange wallet.

Many exchanges do not trade SOL against ETH or BTC directly, so I recommend trading against a stablecoin such as USDC or USDT:

i.e. Sell 0.1 ETH for 375 USDC then purchase 2.5 SOL for 375 USDC

Confirm that you have SOL in your exchange wallet and proceed to [Using Phantom](../using-phantom/)
