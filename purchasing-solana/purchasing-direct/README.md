description: Use a credit card to purchase Solana
---

# Purchasing Direct

Begin by signing up with an [exchange](../exchanges.md).

Use a supported credit card and provide any required KYC information.

Please remember to proceed at your own risk. While these exchanges are reputable, they all carry third-party risk. Like any online service that requires storing customer information, there is always the risk of your information being compromised. 

The exchange will guide you through the process, and after charging your credit card, you will have a Solana wallet within the exchange. 

Once you can confirm a balance of SOL in your exchange wallet, proceed to [`Using Phantom`](../../using-phantom/)``
