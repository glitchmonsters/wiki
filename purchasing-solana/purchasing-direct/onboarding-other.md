# Onboarding (Other)

You can purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum directly with one of the following Canadian services:

#### 1) Shakepay

I have personally been using Shakepay for over a year and I really enjoy the experience so far. There is some KYC and setting up Interac e-transfer with your online banking. Money is sent to Shakepay via etransfer, and the user can purchase either Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Shakepay does not charge a withdraw fee, however, they do have a larger orderbook spread on BTC or ETH, so you often are purchasing a % or 2 higher than market rate.

After purchasing Bitcoin or Ethereum (I recommend Bitcoin for this use-case), you will need to send it to an exchange for Solana. See [Exchange ETH/BTC](../exchange-eth-btc.md)

#### 2) Wealthsimple

I have not tried this, but Wealthsimple is now offering crypto services. I do not believe Solana is a product they have listed yet, so I would recommend purchasing Bitcoin or Ethereum, and then sending BTC or ETH to an exchange for Solana. See [Exchange ETH/BTC](../exchange-eth-btc.md)

#### 3) Coinberry
