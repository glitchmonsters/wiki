# Creating a Wallet

The wallet will present you with a 12 word seed phrase.

Write this phrase down. Don't take a picture of it, don't copy paste it and save it on your computer somewhere. This is the ultimate key. If ANYONE has this phrase, they can have FULL control over the wallet. Double and triple check you wrote down the phrase correctly, and proceed with setting up a password.

Don't worry if you forget the password you set. This is just a temporary lock, like how your computer locks when it goes to sleep. Restoring a wallet with a seed phrase will ignore passwords, so again, KEEP THAT SEED PHRASE SAFE.

I will touch on safety practices later, but for now it's time to Deposit Solana
