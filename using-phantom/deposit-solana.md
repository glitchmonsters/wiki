From the exchange that is holding your Solana, withdraw the Solana and paste your Phantom address as the receiving wallet. The exchange will guide you through the action, and once it is processed, you should be given a Transaction ID or TxID. 

If you would like to see the status of the transaction, you can go to [https://solscan.io/](https://solscan.io) and search the TxID. 

Otherwise, the exchange themselves can take a while to process the withdraws, so expect to wait anywhere from 5 minutes to a few hours. In some cases rare cases, this might over 12 hours to complete. Most exchanges can complete the transfer in a reasonably quick turnaround

Once the Solana arrives it will automatically show up in your Phantom wallet.
